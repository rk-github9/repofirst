How to shift from one branch to other
=======================================
1. git pull origin <branch name>  -- To create particular branch from master 
2. git checkout <branch name>  -- TO switch to that branch and access.
3. git branch  -- To check the which branch git is pointing to.



SSH key (Public Key) -- This is required only to push the code to repository.
                        No key is required to pull the code from respository.

To notify the reviewer about the changes in code, developer will raise a Pull request ( Reviewer Name) and click on " Create Pull Request" . This will send a notification to the reviewer. The status of the request will be in "Open state"

Note: Once reviwer review the code and approve, that means " Close Request" then only code will merge into master.
